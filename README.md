# Modeling-Subjective-Affect-Annotations-with-Multi-Task-Learning
We compare two generic Deep Learning architectures: a Single-Task (ST) architecture and a Multi-Task (MT) architecture. While the ST architecture models single emotional perception each time, the MT architecture jointly models every single annotation and the aggregated annotations at once
